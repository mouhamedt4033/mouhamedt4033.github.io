This week we was learing an easier way to do create more function.so the first day we learned the function defaintion. Mr A gave  us and exprission that was similiar to each other we was to see what was the same and different. So we re-wrote it to see what was the same. We went to making triangles with with the another exprission it was (trinagle 30 "solid" "green") and (trinagle 80 "solid" "green")  that it was the same question that he asked the first time what the same the same was the was the name and the "string" "string" the only that was different was the size
