*This week the big connection that i learned in this week is to make better contract. I mean that since we learned how to make a code that can make the computer understand.like for example first day we was getting to learn about function definition. Mr. Alltta gave us an expression and we had to see what was the difference and the same.so my classmate we all answer that it have alot of the similarites and a little difference. so he gave us another example with functions this time so it was (triangle 30 "solid" "green") and triangle 30 "solid" "green") so the same thing we did and try see what was the same it was the strings and name thats the domain and range.I'll explain what is the domain and range so you how the i told you that we created a function so it will look like this (triangle 30 "solid" "green") another way  that i can show you is ;triangle:30 "string" "string" so the begining of the expression is triangle is the name  next is # and "string" "string" thats the domain and range is what the function will produce like an image. so we found an easier way to create a better function is (define(gt size)(triangle size "solid" "green")) this function can help you create the same image but just change the size that best fit your choice. To remeber how to do this is *
**Steps to define function AKA DESIGN RECIPE**
>step 1 contract 
>step 2 example **(circle what changes)**
>step 3 define
This was the main thing that was the biggest connection of this week learning.
