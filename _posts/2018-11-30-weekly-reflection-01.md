hello, i'm back is was while that i posted something in my blog to today i'm talking about the midterm item learning reflection.  I'm going over a question that was diffuclut was question 16 version 1 thats the version that i had and on to the analysis on that question so the correct answer is (a) this question was a mastery skill 5 and it was a practioner level. I think that this question was great because the analysis the % of the students who picked (a) it was 74.1% on version 1 and version 2 73.1% this is a high prestange of the student that understand this question. This shows Mr. Allata that we the student understand the question and that we learned and improved. I think that this analysis is really helpful to show the proportion correct from the student because it gives the teachers and students what they are strong at and their weakiest. THis is why i picked this question.
