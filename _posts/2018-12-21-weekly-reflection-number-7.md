## Describe your process.


The strategies that i did was is defining the shapes that for the flag and i can put the image into the base to create the United Kingdom flag. I had a little help from my peers when I have a question for them. like for example my question was how to put image because in the past It was not my strong suit but I over come it and is half done. when I looked back at my notes it all become clear and found a way to do my work. I thinking can be better than asking for helpl if you have your notebook aside of you.
