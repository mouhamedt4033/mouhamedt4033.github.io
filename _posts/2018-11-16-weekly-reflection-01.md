*This week reflection  on 11/13 our objective was to see value vs. Funition defintion and the difference between vallue an function is values need arguments "string", image, and numbers. But the function is the name that define the value and it can't change. from this that learning i can now  fully understand what the difference and can make me more better on making creative expression. so this week we was mostly working on examples of definition so we can better understand it.
  ```JAVASCRIPT 
  FUNCTION TEST(;DEFINE MIKE:TRIANGLE 30 "SOLID" "GREEN") {
  CONSOLE. LOG("LOOK MA `, NO SPACE");
  }
  ```
