This week you know how i told you that we are perparing ourselves to creating our own game. on Wednesday we did a project it was meant to help us understanding how to create a charcter. for an example we did a flag this activity was to get us familiar to how we want our flag to look like. What i like about this activity is that when you create a game we work with a peer. I realized that two brain is really helpfu because it allows you to focus on different parts of the problem solving process. I'm really looking forward to our next class.
