*The last week we was getting to move on to the flag project. so we planned it for this week. 
we was doing a Flag Collage made out of paper.But first Mr Alltta wanted us to learn how to create a flag collage with accurate measurement before we get to the computer. I think that his idea was to first make a flag with paper and wanted us to use it as and idea of how you can make flag. In my opinion this idea is smart because i thought we was doing it just to do it but i didn't realize that it was preparing us to get to wescheme to test it out. To tell the truth the task was a little confusing for some student was struggling including me. so what i did wanted to start from scartch so I can figure out what he meant when we was to make the flag collage accurate enough to see how the flag will look like. So I measure the hoist and fly the hosit is 40 that is the height of the flag, and the fly is 60 and that's the length of the flag. I started like that and did the rest to all the shapes that need measurement from there I slowly understand what i'm post to do to the flag.finially the whole point of this project was for us to also make accurate measurement for the flag so when we get to the computer it will come to our a little clear and make us remeber how to do it.*
