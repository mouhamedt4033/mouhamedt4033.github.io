*This week we was creating our flag that was given to us. the flag that I picked a profissioanl flag because i wanted a challenge because me as a person I like to start with hard because I think that when i start with hard I can think on my own. But yesterday when i started it wasn't easy but when i looked back to the other flag project I started to test the put image. To be honest put-image was not my strong suit because I have no problem with making an image but puting an image to a image it was diffuclut. So what i did was define the shapes that I needed for the flag and get all thoes shapes together so i can try to put thoese shapes into one to make the United Kingdom. so im looking forward to finishing my flag because i would like it to finish.
