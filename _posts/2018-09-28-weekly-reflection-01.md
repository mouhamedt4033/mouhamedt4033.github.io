Well, finally got around to putting this website together. neat thing about it - powered by {Jekyll}(http://jekyllrb.com) and I can use Markdown to author my posts. It actually was a lot harder to understand the instructions and the other small parts ot the website than I thought it was going to be. The work for making the the post is geting better because I'm geting the hang on making my blog better. The class is making it easier  for me. 

For the past few weeks of school in the programming class for computer science i've felt confidit about the class and the work too. Right now i'm learning a language about raket (Scheme)and I'm also learning how to use math circle of evlaution. This is  perparing us to make our own video game with a partner. The struggles that i'm going to face is to make the game good without making a mistake and not to have problems creating the game.
