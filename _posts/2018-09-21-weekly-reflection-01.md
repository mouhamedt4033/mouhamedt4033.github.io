For the past few weeks of school in the programming class for computer science i've felt confidit about the class and the work too. Right now i'm learning a language about raket (Scheme)and I'm also learning how to use math circle of evlaution. This is  perparing us to make our own video game with a partner. The struggles that i'm going to face is to make the game good without making a mistake and not to have problems creating the game.
